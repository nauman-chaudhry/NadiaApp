-- Migration 032: tag Outbrain MV rows with their marketer's ad_account_id
--
-- Outbrain campaign rows now carry ad_account_id (the marketer's ad_accounts row,
-- migration 031) so account- and partner-group filtering compose with the source
-- filter. Carries forward all prior Outbrain logic (IA ad_id resolve, Codefuel
-- (gd,r) attribution, granularity de-dup).
--
-- (Originally migration 030: resolve IA-Outbrain user_tag ad_ids to campaigns.)
--
-- FIX (this migration): the IA user_tag first segment is EITHER a campaign_id OR
-- a promoted-link id (~25% of revenue used the ad_id form, landing on unnamed
-- "(Outbrain campaign <hex>)" rows). ob_ia_rev now resolves the hex via
-- outbrain_campaigns (direct) then outbrain_ad_links (link id -> campaign,
-- migration 029). Verified 100% of those ad_id rows resolve to real campaigns.
-- Carries forward Codefuel (gd,r) attribution (028) and granularity de-dup (026).
--
-- Builds on 021 (Taboola Codefuel+IA, tb: prefix strip). Two changes:
--   1. The Taboola IA branches now exclude source_platform='Outbrain' so that
--      IA-Outbrain rows (campaign_ext_id 'ob:<hex>', or unattributed .ob) do NOT
--      leak into the Taboola IA orphan bucket. (The Codefuel branches already
--      filter source to Taboola/NULL, so they need no change.)
--   2. New Outbrain branches join Outbrain cost (outbrain_stats_daily, per
--      campaign per day) to Outbrain revenue:
--        - IA-Outbrain  → attributed per campaign via the HEX user_tag:
--          partner_stats.campaign_ext_id 'ob:<hex>' = outbrain_campaigns.campaign_id.
--        - Codefuel-Outbrain → revenue keyed by (GID, r_param); no (gd,r)→campaign
--          map yet (needs Outbrain promoted-link sync), so it is surfaced as a
--          daily orphan row. Revenue still counts toward the Outbrain total.
--
-- GRAIN: Outbrain cost is DAILY (per-campaign hourly is unavailable, and
--   cost/revenue do not hour-align — see outbrain-tz.ts). Outbrain rows are
--   emitted at day granularity with hour_utc = day_utc at 00:00 UTC. Revenue
--   (stored hourly) is summed to the same day. The campaign/daily views (which
--   sum across hours) reconcile exactly; the hourly view shows Outbrain at hour 0.
--
-- source_platform is set to 'Outbrain' on every Outbrain row (cost and revenue),
-- so the API filters Outbrain via source_platform='Outbrain' and Taboola via
-- source_platform IS DISTINCT FROM 'Outbrain'.
